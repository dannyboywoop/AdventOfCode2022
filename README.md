# [AdventOfCode 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)
AdventOfCode is a yearly event for which a new, two-part, coding challenge is released each day of December until the 25th.

This year I will attempt the challenge in Python and SPARK Ada, with the intension of producing as elegant and readable solutions as I can in Python, before reproducing the solution in SPARK Ada.

In the ReadMe.md file for each day you will find the problems themselves, along with more thorough notes on my solutions.

Some python solutions will import modules from my aoc_tools package, you will need to install this using:
```pip install aoc-tools-dannyboywoop```
